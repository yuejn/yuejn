## Hello! 

ðŸ”­  Besides my full-time, I'm currently working on static-site generators â€” templates, content management systems, and the best way to empower non-tech-savvy folk to get a handle on their digital presence. Apart from that, I write a lot of weird code, and that's OK. 

ðŸŒ±  A lot of what I am coding now is with my company, locked up and not for the public. But I'm working a lot with React and Node.JS with TypeScript (<3).
